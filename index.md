# Options for gender free English Country Dance calling

The growing adoption of "larks" and "ravens" as position terms in contra dance presents
a new option for how to call gender free ECD.  Using these new terms for ECD can be tricky
because of the diversity of proper, improper, and odd-formation dances in the ECD repetroire. 

This note compares several approaches for gender free ECD, describes how ECD was called at 
several events in 2018, and concludes with a recommendation to use "larks" and "ravens" (only) when
they're helpful and only after clarifying, for each dance, the frame of reference in which "left" and
"right" are considered.  

I believe gender free ECD is in a period of rapid change, and this guidance should be taken as
"best *current* practice" only.

This note does not explore the "why" or "why not" for gender free calling, merely the "how".

## Background

There is a long tradtion of gender free ECD using global terminology.  At the LCFD dance in Boston, landmarks (e.g. "the clock side of the hall" or "the window side") are used for the rare occasions when one dancer or one side of a longways set needs to be called out separately from the others.

[Read Weaver's document on Boston's conventions](https://www.lcfd.org/gf-ecd-calling-conventions.html) provides excellent background.  Bruce Hamilton's [Notes on Teaching Country Dance](https://www.cdss.org/index.php/vm-store/books/notes-on-teaching-country-dance-263-detail), while not aimed at gender-free calling, also discusses global directions.

## Frame of Reference

Why is using "larks" and "ravens" terms for ECD trickier than using them for contra and Scottish?  Primarily *frame of reference*.

In squares, circles, and improper dances (including Beckett formation
dances), "larks on the left, ravens on the right" applies as facing into
the minor set.  In a proper longways dance, the frame of reference is
the top of the hall, so there is one long line of larks facing one long
line of ravens.

The modern contra dance repetoire is made up almost exclusively with improper dances.  In these, 
"larks on the left, ravens on the right" makes sense with a
frame of reference of "facing in to the minor set", and that frame of reference is consistent for
nearly all contra dances done in an evening.  It also makes sense for squares where, again, there exists an obvious frame of reference of "face into the center".

By contrast, the modern ECD repetoire has a diverse mix of dance formations.


## Experiences in 2018

I am aware of eight dance camps that used "larks" and "ravens" terminology in 2018 for contra, ECD, and/or Scottish country dance: [Oberlin's Dandelion Romp](http://www2.oberlin.edu/stuorg/dromp/), [Queer Contra Dance Camp](https://www.lcfd.org/sf/DanceCamp/), LCFD spring camp, [LCFD fall camp](https://www.lcfd.org/lcfd/fall-dance-camp/), Swing Into Summer at Pinewoods, ESCape at Pinewoods, [Youth Dance Weekend](https://youthdanceweekend.org/), and the [Next Generation camp](http://www.nextgendancecamp.org/).

I attended six of those camps and called ECD at two.  Here are some observations:


### Global directions and landmarks: Queer Contra Dance Camp, Monte Toyon, April 2018

At Queer Camp, I used global directions and landmarks, consistent with past practice at LCFD camps.


### Setting frame of reference: ESCape - English-Scottish-Contra, Pinewoods, July 2018

At ESCape, contra and Scottish were called with "larks" and "ravens".  ECD was called with "men" and "women".

Terry Harvey established a frame of reference for Scottish dances of "as facing the front of the hall, larks on the left, ravens on the right".  This differed from the frame of reference used in most of the contra dances, with the frame of reference being "face into the minor set".  For the occasional proper contra dance, the caller specified the different frame of reference.

Anecdotally, dancers adapted well to the different frames of reference.


### Reframing / rechoreographing dances: Next Generation Dance Camp, Mt. Hood Kiwanis Camp, October 2018

At the Next Generation dance camp, I called ECD to a group with limited ECD experience by treating
every longways dance as though it were improper.  I instructed the dancers to "line up for every dance as
though you're doing a contra - larks on the left, ravens on the right".  I then used "larks" and "ravens"
even when I previously would have used more global directions.  For example, when calling a traditionally-proper-formation dance, instead of calling a figure for "first corners", I called it for "ravens".  (e.g., Corelli's Maggot began with "ravens" setting to each other.)

On the whole the session went smoothly.  Anecdotally, most dancers did not notice the experiment.  At least one dancer reported confusion - they had heard the name of familiar dance (e.g. Barbarini's Tambourine) and missed the frame of reference setup.  

## Recommendations for leaders:

* Use **global instructions** to avoid naming individual positions whenever possible.
* When naming individual positions is unavoidable, prepare as sets are formed by **establishing the frame of reference** for each dance, ideally using the traditional orientation.  Then use "larks" and "ravens".
* Circles, squares, and other "all face the center" formations are particularly well suited to using "larks" and "ravens".
* Expect evolution in this advice and terms over time.  

## Recommendations for dance organizers:

* Negotiate the use of gender free terms with callers **when they are hired** - while some callers new to gender free calling may welcome using gender free terms, others may be unwilling.  Work this out before commitments are made.
* Do not dictate a particular form of gender free calling.  The choice of which terms to use and whether to rechoreograph dances is evolving, and callers should be given space to experiment.
* Announce the intention to use gender free terms to dancers in advance.
