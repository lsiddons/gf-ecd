# Options for gender free English Country Dance calling

The growing adoption of "larks" and "ravens" as gender free terminology at contra dances presents ECD
leaders with an additional tool for leading gender free ECD.  It can be tricky to use these new terms for ECD
because of the diversity of proper, improper, and odd-formation dances in the ECD repetroire. 

This note compares several approaches for gender free ECD, describes how ECD was called at 
several camps in 2018, and concludes with a recommendation to use "larks" and "ravens" (only) when they're helpful,
but only after clarifying, for each dance, the frame of reference in which "left" and "right" are 
considered.  

This note does not explore the "why" or "why not" for gender free calling, merely the "how".

## Background

There is a long tradtion of gender free ECD using global terminology.  At the Boston dance, landmarks (e.g. "the clock side of the hall" or "the window side") are used for the rare occasions when one dancer or one side of a longways set needs to be called out separately from the others.

[Read Weaver's document on Boston's conventions](https://www.lcfd.org/gf-ecd-calling-conventions.html) provides excellent background.  Bruce Hamilton's [Notes on Teaching Country Dance](https://www.cdss.org/index.php/vm-store/books/notes-on-teaching-country-dance-263-detail), while not aimed at gender-free calling, also has discussion of global directions.

## Frame of Reference

Why is using "larks" and "ravens" terms for ECD trickier than using them for contra and Scottish?  Primarily *frame of reference*.
The modern contra dance repetoire is made up almost exclusively with improper dances.  In these, 
"lark is on the left, raven is on the right" makes sense with a
frame of reference of "facing in to the minor set", and that frame of reference is consistent for
nearly all contra dances done in an evening.  It also makes sense for squares where, again, there's an obvious frame of reference of "face into the center".

By contrast, the modern ECD repetoire has a diverse mix of dance formations.  


## Experiences in 2018

I am aware of eight dance camps that used "larks" and "ravens" terminology in 2018 for contra, ECD, and/or Scottish country dance: Oberlin's Dandelion Romp, Queer Contra Dance Camp, LCFD spring camp, LCFD fall camp, Swing Into Summer at Pinewoods, ESCape at Pinewoods, Youth Dance Weekend, and the Next Generation camp.

I attended six of those camps and called ECD at two.  Here are some observations:


### Global directions and landmarks: Queer Contra Dance Camp, Monte Toyon, April 2018

At Queer Camp, I used global directions and landmarks.


### Setting frame of reference: ESCape - English-Scottish-Contra, Pinewoods, July 2018

At ESCape, contra and Scottish were called with "larks" and "ravens".  ECD was called with "men" and "women".

Terry Harvey established a frame of reference for Scottish dances of "as facing the front of the hall, larks ont he left, ravens on the right".  Notably, this differed from the frame of reference used in most of the contra dances, with the frame of reference being "face into the minor set".

Anecdotally, dancers adapted well to the difference frames of reference.


### Reframing dances: Next Generation Dance Camp, Mt. Hood Kiwanis Camp, October 2018

As an experiment, I rechoreographed proper dances as improper and set an expectation at the start of the
session that every dance would use the same frame of reference as an improper contra dance.  For example, I
started Barbarini's Tambourine with "Ravens cast over your left shoulder".  I used "larks" and "ravens"
even when I would previously have used global directions (e.g. normally I call Barbarini's Tambourine with "first
diagonals cast".

The Next Generation camp expected to draw a crowd with limited ECD experience.  On the whole the session went smoothly.  Anecdotally, most dancers did not notice the experiment.  At least one dancer reported confusion - they had heard the name of familiar dance (e.g. Barbarini's) and missed the frame of reference setup.  


## Recommendations for callers:

* Use **global instructions** to avoid naming individual positions whenever possible.
* When naming individual positions is unavoidable, prepare as sets are formed by establishing the frame of reference for each dance, ideally using the traditional orientation.  Then use "larks" and "ravens".
* Circles, squares, and other "all face the center" formations are particularly well suited to using "larks" and "ravens".
* Expect evolution in this advice and terms over time.  

## Recommendations dance organizers:

* Negotiate the use of gender free terms with callers **when they are hired** - while some callers new to gender free calling may welcome making that transition, others may be unwilling.  It's better to work this out before commitments are made.
* Do not dictate a particular form of gender free calling.  In particular, the choice of which terms to use and whether to rechoreograph dances is evolving, and callers should be given space to experiment.
* Announce the intention to use gender free terms in advance, to avoid surprise among your dancers.
